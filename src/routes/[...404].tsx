        in the depths of the web <br />
        a link goes astray <br />
        a page once alive has now faded away <br />

        clicking through echoes, I search for the sound <br />
        but all that I find is a "

        a whisper of content, a ghost in the code <br />
        lost in the ether, where memories erode
